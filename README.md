When you first open the document, go into the Document Properties and change the `Title` and `Subject` (you may need to click `Show All Properties` to see `Subject`), this will automatically update the header. As you create new pages the header will automatically update including the page number.

Use the styles to make it easier to produce a consistent format:
 - Sushi Normal - normal text
 - Sushi Section Number - in the text that bolded number for a section of text
 - Sushi Section Highlight - to highlight a portion of text
